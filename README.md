# Ray casting
"**Ray casting** is the use of ray–surface intersection tests "Glossary of computer graphics" to solve a variety of problems in 3D  "Computer graphics" and "Computational geometry". The term was first used in computer graphics in a 1982 paper by Scott Roth to describe a method for rendering "Constructive solid geometry" [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting)

After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&t=973s) video, I decided to make an implementation of ray casting on python 3.7 through pygame's library.

The first file, "firstperson.py" is a 3d rendering of the environment created. The second file, "topview.py" is a top down view of the environment, with visible rays.
